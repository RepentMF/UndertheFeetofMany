trailer notes from derek lieu
-*don't apologize for your game- you're showing off a trailer*
-announcement trailer and launch trailer (probably)
-build-up in a trailer should have release
-pacing is important, if you can manage to retain an audience, don't blow it on something
by staying on the topic for too long- show the viewer as much as you can

-ensure that viewer can have a clear view of what the "goal" of the game is
or what the gameplay will be like
-keep it clear what is happening in the trailer- clear is better than too much 
happening on screen
-game audio is very important- sfx acts as percussion or flavor
-you can use music to your advantage for footage cuts/ transitions as well as gameplay 
synchronization
-if you have gameplay on-screen, you have to by virtue, be willing to have gameplay be ignored
-show gameplay that changes other things on screen or basically how your game progresses-
show how different elements of the game interact with each other
-variety is also really important
-show off things that are UNIQUE (in animation or function) to the game
-if you are going to show story, TELL the story- pensive characters or small actions
will not get across what the setup for the story is

-just like what GDC talk said- give 1 WEBSITE or SOCIAL MEDIA for them to follow; viewers
will not follow everything linked/ everything written
-stack as much info TOGETHER at the end-card as you can- this is where people leave your video
so make sure they take important info with them before they leave
