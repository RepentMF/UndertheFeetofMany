-NDA for P*******ia and FHW/ Circle
-If they give you a minimum guarantee (IE $50000, 50%- $100000 made, 
then you make money) P*******ia has not made back MG
-Already on eShop beforehand- could be different if you were with them 
a year before launch
-Playtested the game a lot
-Gave a lot a feedback and taught monkey testing
-Display ads did not help much (IE ads $100, making $80)
-Japanese translation was very good
-Chinese translation was very bad
-$7 avg on $20 game
-Moving copies on Kickstarter is less percentage of sale than
copies on Steam or console
-Kickstarter is good for headlines
-Put on Steam for wishlists
-Kickstarter can color publishers' opinions
