  Description: "Day 1 Father and I fought today. The whole time we\u2019ve been down
    here in these bunkers I\u2019ve hated it. I just want to go home. I want to go
    around town and ride bikes with my friends. I want to look outside. I want to
    be outside. I'll even ride the bus to school so I can write notes to Lisa. But
    no! Father said I was a stupid brat and if we hadn't started living in the bunkers
    we'd be dead like Lisa. I know she\u2019s still alive, and I know he said it
    just to hurt me. I shouldn\u2019t have lost control like I did, but it felt so
    good to hit him hard across the face. He grabbed me and locked me in this place.
    I could only hear him shouting and laughing about something as he walked away. 
    Wait until mom hears about this.  Day 5 Father has been a liar this entire time.
    He said that we would be able to go back to the outside world eventually, but
    this whole time he\u2019s just been working on his stupid chapel. He kept taking
    me to this place he called the \u201CFirst Basement\u201D and trying to get me
    used to living down here. To \u201Csee the revelation that they've all seen.\"
    All I see in him is a snake. He was just telling mom and I what we wanted to
    hear. When I get out I\u2019m gonna to talk to mom and make her realize that
    he wants us here just to walk around all high and mighty and judge everyone.
    Then she\u2019ll see the same monster and escape with me.  Day 13? I think it\u2019s
    been a few days. I bet the whole underground is looking for me, and he\u2019s
    lying through his rotten teeth about where I am. They'll find me though. Mom'll
    find me.   Day (the number is illegible) This entry is noticeably ragged. I miss
    you mom. Please find me. I love you too. I'll say it back."
