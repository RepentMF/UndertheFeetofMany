  Description: "Page 1, September 15, 2030, ID:1440, M-4478 \u201CNo one\u2019s been
    able to gather water from the new well for about a week. We thought it might
    be able to fix itself, but the sanatorium is filling up fast and pretty soon
    there won\u2019t be enough drinking water to go around. I volunteered to fix
    whatever is causing the water to leak out of the receptacle.\u201D -Darren Dyver,
    C.R.T.\u201D Page 2, \u201CHey D. Dyve, I don\u2019t know about you, but I wonder
    what Dana is cooking tonight. She\u2019s been wanting to make this rice dish
    with the spicy sausages for a while. I can\u2019t remember the name of it, and
    it will probably be too spicy, but it\u2019ll be worth it to see her smile again.\u201D"
